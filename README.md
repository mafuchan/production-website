After many, many failures, this site was developed to showcase my disdain for Pokemon, yet at the same time, my love for Psyduck. A user coming to this site would be able to learn all that there is to know about Psyduck.
The site is connected to the PokeAPI and pulls information and images for Psyduck and his evolution Golduck specifically. While the previous Pokemon project pulled a list of abilities, this one showcases their moves.
Form data is included on the landing page to capture a name and email address and what the visitor's favorite Pokemon is.
