        <h2>What is Pokemon?</h2>
        <article id="summary">Pokemon, or Pocket Monsters, is a media megatitan that was originally created in 1996 as a
            pair
            of video
            games released for the Nintendo Game Boy. Later in the same year it was converted into a collectible trading
            card game; which is still the best selling trading card game of all time.<br>
            The folllowing year, the first animated series was released in Japan, followed by more than 25 movies and
            too many confusing non-related TV series as well. Seriously, I can't keep up with how many series there are
            and who or what does not exist in the continuities.<br>
            As if they weren't taking all of our money through videos and cards, there are at least 38 different
            videogames out there. Generally released in pairs, if you want to "catch them all", then you're gonna have
            to shell out the dough. See why I despise this franchise? My kids would bankrupt me if they got too into
            it.
